#Random Drops of Knowledge

-translation unit is source file AFTER pre-processing b/c of include and include guards 

-compiling has 2 steps: (1)compiling and (2)linking;  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5115556/c-using-namespace-and-include

-put "include"s together, and THEN all "using"s; otherwise, a "using" allows "include"s below to bypass the qualifier 

-include guards > pragma once??? b/c http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1143936/pragma-once-vs-include-guards

-compilation of template code http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19798325/template-compilation

-typename vs class keyword http://stackoverflow.com/questions/213121/use-class-or-typename-for-template-parameters

#Navigating the Files

-main.cpp runs example code for each topic-of-interest

-each topic can have an additional appropriately-named file(s)

-topic information can be found at the top of those files

-numbered information comes with example code; non-numbered information does not
